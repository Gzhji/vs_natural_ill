###3D Layout Estimation ut from 2D Panorama  

Please use [LED2-Net](https://github.com/fuenwang/LED2-Net) to estimate 3D layout.
Place the output image (color.jpg) and JSON file into one folder named by the scene name (eg.'new+penn+bed+07091127') and place folder under folder '/00_Data/zind/scenes/layout_merge'.

To get segmented indoor planar surfaces, *Run floormesh.py --split='new+penn+bed+07091127'*
